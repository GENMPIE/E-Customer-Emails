Send an email to the client easily via the WooCommerce Order screen.

== Description ==

This plugin can help you save time writing emails. Instead of opening your mail, copy the email adress of the client and type your mail, it is now way easier! You just open the order of the client and you can type your message in the box this plugin is creating for you.
It is recommended to use a SMTP plugin that is configuring the `wp_mail()` function, so you are sure the mails are being sent to the client.
